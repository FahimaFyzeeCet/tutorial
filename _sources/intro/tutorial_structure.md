Alternatively the text on this page covers the same material as the video.
```

This tutorial will mostly be asynchronous and self-guided. All of the material
needed to go through this tutorial is here on this website. 

We will have a set of synchronous Zoom "office hours" after particular sections where we
will be available to answer questions about that section.

You are free to do this tutorial on your own time, if you choose.
This website and materials will be available after the allotted tutorial time.


## How this Tutorial is Structured

There are many videos throughout the tutorial that will guide you through the main 
concepts. The content of the videos will mirror the text that surrounds them,
therefore you can either:
 
<p align="center"><b>
Watch the videos
</b></p>
 
<p align="center"><b>
OR
</b></p>
 
<p align="center"><b>
Read the text.
</b></p>

Both will give you the same information overall, although the text might go into
more detail on certain subjects and will provide references for further reading.
We will mark the sections in the text that you can practically skip, but we
hope this document can act as a reference point if you decide come back at a 
later time. If for some reason you are unable to load the YouTube videos, we have
provided OneDrive links to the videos on the page for each section.

entire tutorial. If you don't see the contents, click the hamburger (&#9776;) icon
to expand the left-hand column. On the right-hand side of the page you'll see 
the table of contents for this particular page. To navigate to the next section
you can either click on the next section on the tutorial's table of contents on 
the left-hand side, or you can scroll to the bottom of the page to click the

## How to Use This Book

All of the material presented here is written in the `python3` programming language.
It is presented in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/),
which allows us to interweave the lecture material with the code interactively.
The notebooks we have provided should be ready to go to run all of the
code and experiments without any further setup. 

We have also included [github repo](https://github.com/source-separation/ismir2020-tutorial)
and `requirements.txt` to set up your own environment
so that you can use these tools after the tutorial is run.
