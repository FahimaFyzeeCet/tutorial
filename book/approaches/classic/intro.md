Now that we know the basics of spectrograms, masking, and phase, we have all of
the building blocks for diving into source separation.

Like many other areas of computing, it's important to understand the assumptions
that source separation approaches make. To get a feel for the mechanics of 
source separation, we will begin learning some "classic" algorithms[^fn1]
that are 
 
 
 
[^fn1]: We understand that some people might take issue with us declaring all 
non-deep learning source separation approaches, but
