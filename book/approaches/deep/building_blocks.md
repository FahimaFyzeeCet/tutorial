The Building Blocks of Deep Nets for Source Separation
======================================================


## Neural Network Components

### Fully Connected Layers

### Recurrent Layers

- "we used a 600 unit BLSTM layer" would you assume that means 600 in each direction (how you'd write it in pytorch), or 300 in each direction (more accurate)

### Convolutional Layers

### Normalization

### Dropout

### Activation Functions

### Masking Layers

### Spectrogram Components

- Calculating Spectrograms ahead of time
- Computing Spectrograms on the fly
- Mel Spectrograms

### Learned Filter Banks


## How many models are there?

## Loss Functions

### Spectrogram Losses

L1 & MSE
MSA, PSA


### Clustering Losses


### Waveform Losses

SI-SDR loss
